**1. Security Best Practices**  
- **Limit inbound traffic:** Your security group allows HTTP (port 80) from `0.0.0.0/0`, which is open to the internet. If possible, restrict this to known IPs.  
  âœ… **Solution:** Change `cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]` to a more restricted IP range.  

- **IAM Role Least Privilege:** Your ECS task IAM role (`fargate-assume-role`) assumes ECS Task Execution permissions but does not have any specific policies attached.  
  âœ… **Solution:** Attach policies like `AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy` to allow the task to pull images, write logs, etc.  



**2. Networking Best Practices**  
- **Subnet Selection:** You're using `data "aws_subnets" "default"` to retrieve subnets but haven't explicitly created or selected subnets. If the VPC lacks public subnets, the ECS service may fail to launch.  
  âœ… **Solution:** Explicitly define and use public subnets.  

- **Load Balancer for High Availability:** You're exposing the ECS service but not using a Load Balancer, meaning direct traffic hits individual tasks.  
  âœ… **Solution:** Use an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute traffic across ECS tasks.  



**3. Performance Optimization**  
- **Task CPU & Memory Tuning:** You're using `cpu = "256"` and `memory = "512"`, which may be insufficient for production workloads.  
  âœ… **Solution:** Optimize these values based on your application requirements.  

- **Fargate Capacity Provider Weight:** The weight of `5` in `aws_ecs_cluster_capacity_providers` could lead to resource inefficiency if you plan to scale horizontally.  
  âœ… **Solution:** Tune `base` and `weight` according to expected workload.  

  

**4. Maintainability & Scalability**  
- **Modularize Terraform Code:** The current monolithic structure makes scaling difficult.  
  âœ… **Solution:** Split the configuration into modules (`networking.tf`, `ecs.tf`, `iam.tf`, etc.).  

- **Use Variables:** Hardcoded values like `region = "af-south-1"` reduce reusability.  
  âœ… **Solution:** Use Terraform variables (`variables.tf`) for flexibility.  

Would you like me to modify the Terraform code with these improvements? ðŸš€
