To aggregate **API Gateway metrics by service path** (like `/approval/*`, `/cart/*`, etc.), especially when you have **many methods under each base path**, there are **two main approaches** in AWS:

---

## ✅ 1. **Use API Gateway Stage + Method Dimensions (Manual Aggregation)**

API Gateway metrics can be filtered by:

* `ApiName`
* `Stage`
* `Method`
* `Resource`

But **CloudWatch doesn't support wildcard filters directly** (like `/cart/*`). So you **must aggregate manually** by combining relevant resources in your dashboard widget.

### Example: Aggregate `/cart/*` Metrics

```hcl
locals {
  cart_paths = ["/cart/add", "/cart/remove", "/cart/update"]

  cart_widget = {
    type = "metric"
    width = 6
    height = 6
    properties = {
      title  = "Cart Metrics - 4XX Errors"
      view   = "timeSeries"
      stacked = false
      region = data.aws_region.current.name
      metrics = [
        for path in local.cart_paths : [
          "AWS/ApiGateway", "4XXError", "ApiName", var.api_name, "Resource", path
        ]
      ]
      period = 60
      stat   = "Sum"
      legend = {
        position = "bottom"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Repeat similar logic for `/approval/*`.

---

## ✅ 2. **Use CloudWatch Metric Math to Aggregate**

CloudWatch supports **metric math**, so you can:

* Create individual metrics per method/resource (e.g., `/cart/add`, `/cart/remove`)
* Sum them using expressions

### Example: Using Metric Math in Terraform

```hcl
locals {
  cart_metrics = [
    ["AWS/ApiGateway", "4XXError", "ApiName", var.api_name, "Resource", "/cart/add"],
    ["AWS/ApiGateway", "4XXError", "ApiName", var.api_name, "Resource", "/cart/remove"],
    ["AWS/ApiGateway", "4XXError", "ApiName", var.api_name, "Resource", "/cart/update"]
  ]
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_dashboard" "cart_dashboard" {
  dashboard_name = "cart-service-dashboard"
  dashboard_body = jsonencode({
    widgets = [
      {
        type = "metric"
        width = 12
        height = 6
        properties = {
          title = "Cart Service - 4XX Errors"
          view  = "timeSeries"
          region = data.aws_region.current.name
          stacked = false
          metrics = concat(
            [
              for idx, m in local.cart_metrics : [
                m[0], m[1], m[2], m[3], m[4], m[5], { id = "m${idx}" }
              ]
            ],
            [
              [ ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", { id = "e1", expression = "SUM(m0, m1, m2)", label = "Total 4XX", stat = "Sum" } ]
            ]
          )
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}
```

---

## ✅ 3. **Alternative (Better Observability): Use CloudWatch Embedded Metrics or Logs**

If you want **wildcard path tracking**, consider:

* **Structured logging + CloudWatch Logs Insights**
* **Embedded metrics format** to log aggregated metrics from Lambda or custom apps

This way, you can emit:

```json
{
  "_aws": {
    "CloudWatchMetrics": [
      {
        "Namespace": "MyApp",
        "Dimensions": [["Service"]],
        "Metrics": [{ "Name": "Latency", "Unit": "Milliseconds" }]
      }
    ]
  },
  "Service": "cart",
  "Latency": 123
}
```

Then query or visualize `Service = cart` over time.

## ✅ Best Practice Strategy:

| Goal                                    | Approach                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fast Terraform-based dashboards         | Use multiple static resource lists per service (`/cart`, `/approval`) and aggregate manually |
| Reduce effort & high flexibility        | Use **metric math** to combine many resources                                                |
| Real-time custom aggregation by service | Use **Embedded Metrics Format** with Lambda or application logging                           |
| Want wildcard filtering                 | Not supported directly in CloudWatch → simulate using `Resource` tags and consistent naming  |

Would you like a Terraform-ready version for metric math aggregation per service like `/approval` and `/cart`?
